About the manufacturer: The Mountain as a company grew from dress roots when two lifelong friends moved from new jersey to new hampshire and began creating belts and buckles to sell. The most popular product was a buckle of a mountain on the back that became the company's calling card. When The Mountain incorporated and introduced its first t-shirt back in the early 90s. On that epic moment in history we made a very important decision to put the environment first by choosing water based inks and organic reactive dyes as the foundation of our production process. Since then, expanded and evolved into something that makes us pretty unique in our industry; and we are pretty proud of that."

      "titolo": "Benefits and BackgroundBy Orogem Fabulous Look with Many Options on WearingThe Ear Pin was created by JJ Porcell, owner of Orogem, in 1986 to visually give the illusion of an earring that would defy gravity and gently ride up along the ear lobe. In 1986, women across America were just starting the trend of having multiple piercings in their ear. JJ Porcell challenged himself to create an earring that would give the illusion of having multiple piercings. With the Ear Pin, you don’t even need a pierced hole to wear the design but yet you can still have that look.As a Pierced Earring in a Single Pierced Ear The number one feedback we get from women who have discovered the Ear Pin is that it is comfortable. By slightly adjusting the wire of the design so it’s not too tight, you won’t even feel The Ear Pin when it’s on the ear. They are lightweight and do not pull down or pinch.Attention should also be paid to the length of the design. Sometimes women with a tiny ear lobe have problems with the Ear Pin being too long or falling off the edge. We recommend for those women that they simply slide the design onto the ear and not through their pierced hole. This will make the design ride ¼” to 1/8” lower on the ear. It won’t be as long and at the same time, they can wear a simple stud in the pierced hole and have The Ear Pin go right around it.As a Pierced Earring in a Multiple Pierced EarFor some women, their ear lobes allow them to wear their favorite hoop, stud, dangle in their first pierced hole and slide The Ear Pin in their second, third or even fourth pierced hole. This all depends on the ear lobe and where the wearer’s pierced holes are positioned. The majority of women can do this providing them with a wonderful new design while they can still wearing their favorite earrings.As a Non-Pierced Earring in a Non-Pierced EarJust like a paper clip slides on a piece of or a bobby pin slides in your hair, the Ear Pin works the same way for women without pierced ears. They are not heavy like the majority of clip-on earrings. They gently grip the ear lobe dependent on how you have adjusted the wire.The Ear Pin opens up a whole new look and concept to women without pierced ears and with comfort being the number one aspect, you can still have a fresh new look in earring wear. There is a Right and Left SideAlthough you can have fun in trying on the Ear Pin and wearing them however you like, there is a recommended right and left side for the design. We recommend, for the best overall look, that the tip of the design (the top of the design on the ear) point in towards the ear rather than away or off the ear. You will notice each design ends with a slight curve and that “S” shape curve should point in rather than away from the ear. Moms Can Have Their Little Girls Wear Them TooMany Moms just aren’t ready for their young daughter to pierce their ears yet. When that young daughter wants to dress up and be just like Mom, she can wear The Ear Pin too without having to have her ears pierced. Conservative in look and respecting Mom’s wishes, everyone wins with the Ear Pin. Fun to be Different and Show Your Personality The Ear Pin attracts all types of glances, wondrous looks and inquisitive questions. People are so amazed at seeing an earring ride up along the ear, they just can’t figure out how it works. Most think you need a pierced hole at the top to hold it in place.It’s a great way to get conversations started and show a side of your personality that is unique, daring and fun. What you wear expresses a lot of who you are and with this innovative look, show the world that fun and daring side. You will also be surprised at how men find the design especially appealing on a woman’s ear. The “S” shape curve of the design is sexy with its feminine shape. Misconception of Being a FadFirst designed in 1986 by Jose “JJ” Porcell of California, The Ear Pin was first looked at as being a fad. In the past 26 years, we have discovered that 80% of women that have purchased Ear Pins are over the age of 40. All types of letters and testimonials have been received from women who express their experience in wearing earrings. They respond heavily with positive feedback as to comfort and the Ear Pin’s unique design feature. With time, The Ear Pin has not become a fad but rather an earring of choice and for many, a collectible within their earring collection.Common Mistakes in PresentationSince we are so used to everything pointing downward, many retailers display and present the Ear Pin upside down. This causes many people to think that his is an earring with a French wire. This design can be used as a drop earring if someone prefers, however the Ear Pin is designed to be worn up the ear giving the wearer a unique and interesting look and to prevent one from having to pierce their ears multiple times.To eliminate that misconception, we want it to be clear and always recommend on showing and displaying The Ear Pin the way it is intended to be worn.
